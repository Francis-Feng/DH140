# DH140

### Description
Dataset Link: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/astronauts/

The dataset above is created with publicly available data from NASA and includes all of the space missions before 15 January 2020. The dataset focuses on both the astronauts themselves such as full astronaut name, sex, date of birth, nationality, military status, a title and year of a selection program. In addition to information regarding the astronauts, the dataset also includes details of the mission with metrics such as duration of the mission and extravehicular activity.

### Motivation
As someone with a passion for space exploration, this dataset from CORGIS immediately captured my attention as I found it extremely intriguing. The dataset itself also provides a considerable amount of information that will prove to be valuable in my analysis.

### Analysis Questions
How has space exploration advanced in the past decades?
How has the demographic of astronauts changed over time?
What does this dataset reveal about the space race and how has each country played a role in it?
